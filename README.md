# Tower-Descent
A rogue-like dungeon crawl that uses procedural-generated tiles  
Part of The Three Wisemen GameJam 2018.

## Concepts
- A ‘dungeon crawler’
- Random/Procedural-generated tiles that increase in difficulty
- Increases in stranger/more eldritch the deeper you go (ala end of Uzimaki?) (ala Blooborne’s tiered dungeons as well)
- Special story/lore tiles that have a lower spawn rate
- Secrets can open new areas full of new story/lore/loot
- The tower entrance is surrounded by a town, the hub world (ala Rogue Legacy?)
- Grow the Town with knowledge and materials you find within the Dungeons (Dark Souls 3, Diablo 3).
- Romancing NPCs, or else building relationships. This could be simply cosmetic, but should also include some mechanical benefit.  (Character unique item? Shop discounts?)
